Give a clear and concise description on how to REPRODUCE the bug.

Simply deploy multiple TKGs clusters at one time.

I have tested this with 5, 10, 20, and more at one time. Many Many "failures"

What did you expect to happen (expected results): We expect to see the cluster to be created

What steps did you take and what happened (actual results): Using TMC CLI or UI, a very large number of clusters more then 50% at times get stuck in creating for hours or days



Impact of the issue (with affected customers, if any): Livefire does global enablement for partners, this is failing like this with them at the controls. It does not look good.




Environment:

VC Build Number (buildwebofficialbuild #): 7.0.2 Build 17694817

Artifacts needed to be attached (required):

1. Please include WCP support bundles in bug reports for all product issues. Support bundles can be retrieved by logging into the VC UI and selecting Menu -> Workload Platform -> Clusters -> Export Logs, with the appropriateclusterselected.

Trying to export logs gives this error, after a download started but failed

The request could not be completed. Another download of logs may be in progress already or another error occurred, try again in a few minutes.

2. TKC support bundle for the affected Tanzu Kubernetes Cluster (please follow the steps https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/80949 to acquire that support bundle)
